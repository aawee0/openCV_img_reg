# openCV_img_reg

This C++ project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Professional and OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision). It performs image registration, which is a process of finding an aligning transformation (B-spline warping in our case) between two images: source (presented by src.jpg) and target (trg.jpg). 

The program works on low-resolution images for better speed and displays the result (screenshot: result_trg_cmd.jpg, left) of a warping that makes the source as similar to the target as possible.
